\subsection{Plan to accomplish today}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Build basic Etherium contract following tutorial from source 1. Have a basic prototype running on node.js
	\item consider how to port it to a python version
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Today I learned: how to get started with Ethereum}


\begin{itemize}
	\item install Geth: so I can run ethereum client on computer
		\begin{itemize}	
			\item source: http://candidtim.github.io/ethereum/2016/03/24/ethereum-quick-start.html
		\end{itemize}
	% 
	\item doing this \[geth --testnet --datadir ~/.ethereum-testnet\] will download entire testnet blockchain onto computer
	% 
	\item doing this: \[geth --fast --cache 1024\] downloads a compressed (?) version of blockchain
	% 
	\item Test RPC is a client for testing:
	% 
			testrpc is a Node.js based Ethereum client for testing and development. It uses ethereumjs to simulate full client behavior and make developing Ethereum applications much faster. It also includes all popular RPC functions and features (like events) and can be run deterministically to make development a breeze.
	% 
			While Geth is a full client in GO Language that you can use to connect to the real chain, or start your own testnet server.
	% 
			geth is the the command line interface for running a full ethereum node implemented in Go. It is the main deliverable of the Frontier Release
	% 
	\item mine blocks and earn ether on testnet
	%

\begin{itemize}
	\item Build basic Etherium contract following tutorial from source 1. Have a basic prototype running on node.js
	\item consider how to port it to a python version
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Today I learned: how to develop basic Ethereum contract with Geth}

Note, lightweight etherium client development is incomplete, so mobile support is weak.

\begin{itemize}
	\item install geth: \[bash <(curl -L https://install-geth.ethereum.org)\], it's a go based ethereum virtual machine (EVM).
	\item start geth \[geth --dev console\]
	\item list accounts \[eth.accounts\]
	\item create a test account \[personal.newAccount()\]
	\item check balance: \[eth.getBalance(eth.accounts[i])\]
	\item write a contract in Solidity, a Javascript-derived language. It can be compile to bytecode using \[sol-c\] compiler
	\item sol-c compiler is installed globally with \[npm install -g solc\]
	\item Three pieces of software to keep in mind when developing:
 }}		\begin{itemize}
			\item Ethereum Node (Geth server): Runs the node and maintain connection to rest of server, run by running \[geth console\]
			\item Console: allow javascript command-line interface to the server. 
			can open it with \[geth console\], or run \[geth\], then in a separate window do \[geth attach\] Note if we have \[hello.js\], then we can load it into geth console with \[loadScript("path/to/hello.js")\]
			\item Ethereum Wallet (aka Mist): GUI for interfacing with wallets and deploying contracts. Will look for /Users/emunsing/Library/Ethereum/geth.ipc and if it does not find geth.ipc the Wallet will start up a server for the node.
			\item JSON RPC API: lightweight format, it is what is communicated over the network. \[web3.js\] is a library that implents this API.

\title{December 31st}

Today's goals: finish reading Ethereum documentation, write minimal contract and send it over the private network.


\title{January 1st}

Today's goals: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item finish reading Ethereum documentation.
	\item write minimal contract and send it over the private network.
	\item get a basic REPL workflow for contracts running on EVM 
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
	\item comprehensive step by step of writing a contract: https://auth0.com/blog/an-introduction-to-ethereum-and-smart-contracts-part-2/
	\item an example of a crowdsale: https://www.ethereum.org/crowdsale
\end{itemize}


\title{January 2nd}

Today's goals:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Navigate to a page on node.js website, and do [something] with the contracts
\end{itemize}

Today's accomplishments:

\begin{itemize}
	\item setup private geth network and mined for ether
	\item interacted with private network via a node.js program
\end{itemize}


\title{January 3rd}

Today's goals:

\begin{itemize}
	\item develop a minimum contract and watch how it interacts with the network
	\item develop a node front/backend that pipes the contract around
	\item figure out how the pieces of the system work with each other
\end{itemize}


Today's todos towards goals:

\begin{itemize}
	\item figure out what adress and private keys are 
	\item follow login contract tutorial to get a sense of how things fit together
	\item try sending a contract over the console. learn how contracts compile
	\item make a basic web interface
\end{itemize}

Today's discovered workflow:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item write contract in .sol
	\item load as newline tab stripped string into javascript file
	\item compile in javascript file
\end{enumerate}	

What I learned:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Contract Defintion: Formal definition in high-level code (e.g. solidity).
	% 
	\item Compiled Contract: The contract converted to byte-code to run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), adhering to the specification. Note the function names and input parameters are hashed during compilation. Therefore, for another account to call a function, it must first be given the funtion name and arguments - hence the ABI:
	% 
	\item Application Binary Interface - ABI: A list of the contract's functions and arguments (in JSON1 format). An account wishing to use a smart contract's function uses the ABI to hash the function definition so it can create the EVM bytecode required to call the function. This is then included in the data field, Td, of a transaction and interpreted by the EVM with the code at the target account (the address of the contract).
\end{enumerate}

			\item asynch triggers with data
			\item cheaper form of storage
		\end{enumerate}
	\item I sent a contract to the private blockchain, mutated its value and 
		  saw that it persisted on the chain
\end{enumerate}

workflow:

\title{Template Notes}

Information we want to communicate: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Simplicity!!!
	\item What we do: Trust as a Commodity
	\item Who we are: Ivy league graduates from Math, Computer Science, and Statistics background
	\item Issuing Cryptocurrency
\end{enumerate}

Emotions we want to communicate

\begin{enumerate}
	\item optimism
	\item hopefullness
	\item trustworthiness
	\item aspirational
\end{enumerate}

Things to avoid:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item something too stodgy
	\item something that looks like we think of ourselves more seriously
	\item something that says: me too. Ie a bootstrap template that looks just everything else out there
	\item something that shows muddle thoughts, ie too complex of a template
\end{enumerate}

/**
	so let's simplify in what we need:
		- a backend computational process that takes in parameters
		- a pipe that sends stuff to the front end
		- a rendering engine on the front end that renders stuff	

	so what we need is first confirm we can pipe something to the front end ... 
		game plan:
	
		I. Render graph
			1. use the premade template because we know for sure it works
			2. figure out how to write backend code that sends stuff to the front end
					1. 
			3. assert the front end can receive and render it

		II. Render excel-like table
			1. find a frontend template that works
			2. assert it can receive JSON and render as expected

		III. decide on persistance, is it needed?

	1. set up a database so we can persist things
	2. make sure we can refresh from the front and hardcode things so that things refresh in the back

	pick a dark template, and a light template and develope it

Hey Zoe,

Thank you so much for reaching out today! Here is a short description of our project. 

The Problem
 
Trust is the corner stone of every human relationship. Trust it is the bedrock of human society.  And yet when we meet people, we rely on peripheral cues to determine whether someone is trustworthy: where they went to school, what jobs do they have, what do they wear, how they treat the waiters. But experience tells us that these signals are far from sufficient. Online sources are similarly flawed, LinkedIn tells us what a person has accomplished, not how he treats others while en-route to the accomplishments. Facebook and Instagram are similarly lacking.  What we need is an incorruptible protocol that records every transaction a person has with other people, so as to record whether value is created in each transaction. 

The Protocol 

We propose a decentralized protocol that records every human transaction that 1. could generate value, and 2. is not properly captured by fiat money.  A distributed auditing algorithm will ensure the transaction was faithfully recorded, we call this process “validation mining”.  Then a market based process will reify the value-add into newly issued crypto-tokens, which are distributed among the two parties. We call this process “social mining.” The tokens are stored in each user’s wallet, whose wealth is visible to all. The wallet has two value add: 1. it is an incorruptible signal of a user’s trustworthiness, 2. the user can spend the tokens when she enters a new community where she has no social capital. However her wallet is a store of previously accumulated social capital, and other people will engage the user in exchange for tokens. 

This is a brief description of the protocol’s value add, there are obvious problems which we have considered:

Different communities may value different things, what is the appropriate exchange rate between communities 
How do we incentives constant engagement with the application so that daily transactions are recorded.
Should the system control what is considered “pro-social behavior”, or should it be a purely market based incentive. 
How do we protect the system’s integrity from the myriad of attacks that could happen in the real world.

These are just a hint of the various problems we have considered. We do not propose this problem has a perfect solution, instead we have built a team that can solve problems as they arise.
