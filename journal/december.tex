\title{December 22nd}

\subsection{Summary}

What I accomplished today:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Register for Coinbase
	\item Bought 99 dollars of Bitcoin
	\item Register for GDAX
	\item download historical prices of all the assets traded on GDAX
\end{enumerate}

Here are some trade ideas:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item correlation between bitcoin vs {litecoin, etherium, twitter feed}
	\item figure out if you buy assets at prices p and q, it is actually locked at those 
	\item figure out how frequently you can buy with bots
	\item read about basic volatitliy strategies
	\item get historical prices of all the assets
	\item run some sort of correlation, how do you know if it's spurious?
	\item run twitter feed corelation, figure out the in time between positive vs negative
	  sentiment and think about when to place orders
\end{enumerate}
