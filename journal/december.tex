\title{December 23rd}

today's plans:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item read through rickyhan's blog and see what you can draft off of
	\item start with coinbase account and API
	\item figure out the relationship between bitcoin wallet, my bank account, and coinbase account
	\item as a warmup exercise, learn how to backtest among different currencies on GDAX
	\item part one is getting historical data
	\item part two is getting a live feed of the data
	\item part three is developing a workflow that makes sense to you
	\item make appropriate plots in case you need a blog
	\item figure out how to do the same thing with GDAX
\end{enumerate}


end of day deliverables: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item all historical data for all crypto-coins on disk
	\item 
\end{enumerate}

here are some setbacks:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item do not have driver's license therefore cannot signup for GDAX
\end{enumerate}


Here are some trade ideas:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item download historical prices of all the assets traded on GDAX
	\item correlation between bitcoin vs {litecoin, etherium, twitter feed}
	\item figure out if you buy assets at prices p and q, it is actually locked at those 
	\item figure out how frequently you can buy with bots
	\item read about basic volatitliy strategies
	\item get historical prices of all the assets
	\item run some sort of correlation, how do you know if it's spurious?
	\item run twitter feed corelation, figure out the in time between positive vs negative
	  sentiment and think about when to place orders
\end{enumerate}
