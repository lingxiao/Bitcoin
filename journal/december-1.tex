\title{December 22nd}

\subsection{Summary}

What I will accomplished today:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Register for Coinbase
	\item Bought 99 dollars of Bitcoin
	\item Figure out the latency issue on putting in orders
	\item Register for GDAX
\end{itemize}


\title{December 23rd}

Next 5 day plan in broad strokes:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item read through rickyhan's blog and see what you can draft off of
	\item start with coinbase account and API
	\item figure out the relationship between bitcoin wallet, my bank account, and coinbase account
	\item as a warmup exercise, learn how to backtest among different currencies on GDAX
	\item part one is getting historical data
	\item part two is getting a live feed of the data
	\item part three is developing a workflow that makes sense to you
	\item make appropriate plots in case you need a blog
	\item figure out how to do the same thing with GDAX
\end{enumerate}


End of day deliverables: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \st{decide on an exchange to trade from: GDAX}
	\item \st{decide on a database: Google BigTable}
	% 
	\item set up a google cloud account, check the one you already have
	\item run an instance of Bigtable and insert and remove things from the database
	% 
	\item have a minimal python trading environment for: backtesting, recording pnl, and interact with database you    have
	\item consider the possibility of not using a trading environment, and just place orders using the raw API
	\item could run a hello world tradebot where you flip coins and buy/sell 5 USD of bitcoins over a 2 minute period

	% 
	\item all historical data for all crypto-coins on disk
	\item figure out how to host the database, insert and remove items from the database
	\item figure out how much it cost to host the database
	\item a hello world thing should have 
\end{enumerate}

here are some setbacks:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item do not have driver's license therefore cannot signup for GDAX
	\item bittrex is down for new users
\end{enumerate}

Here are some trade ideas:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item consider using this resource as a starter: https://blog.patricktriest.com/analyzing-cryptocurrencies-python/
	to get used to the libraries needed for analysis
	\item download historical prices of all the assets traded on GDAX
	\item correlation between bitcoin vs {litecoin, etherium, twitter feed}
	\item figure out if you buy assets at prices p and q, it is actually locked at those 
	\item figure out how frequently you can buy with bots
	\item read about basic volatitliy strategies
	\item get historical prices of all the assets
	\item run some sort of correlation, how do you know if it's spurious?
	\item run twitter feed corelation, figure out the in time between positive vs negative
	  sentiment and think about when to place orders
\end{enumerate}
